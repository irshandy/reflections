? What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do
it?
* When a repository is initialized, a .git directory is created inside
the directory initialized. This will enable us to use git commands in-
side the directory. We can also use file tracking now.

? How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
* Staging area is an intermediate area between working directory and
the repository. It offers more control on which files we want to add
to the repository.

? How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical change?
* By using staging area, we can add only the file we changed and we
should make sure we committed once per logical change we made.

? What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?
* Branches would be helpful if we are trying to experiment big in the
code or if we are trying to refactor the code. Branches would enable
differentiation between two version of program.

? How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
* Diagrams can help visualize the branch structure by showing existing
branches and commits in each branch. It makes it easier to visualize
the structure of the branch.
