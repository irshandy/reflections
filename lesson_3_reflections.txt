? When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
* Remote repository is useful for easier sharing and if we work not on the same computer every time.

? Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
* Usually we want our file to be ready before making it into public. When the remote repository is always up-to-date,
sometimes the files pushed into the remote repository is not yet ready and is buggy.
