? When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?
* Remote repository is useful for easier sharing and if we work not
on the same computer every time.

? Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
* Usually we want our file to be ready before making it into public.
When the remote repository is always up-to-date,
sometimes the files pushed into the remote repository is not yet
ready and is buggy.

? Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?
* Forks is used when we want to "clone" repositories on GitHub. Forks
is used when we don't want to modify the
original repositories. Clones is used when we want to have a copy of
a repositories either from remote or local
repositories in our computer. Branches is used when we want to make
changes that won't affect the original branch.

? What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally?
* We can work offline and it saves a lot of data when pushing changes
to GitHub. It also gives the possibility to do a quick check which 
changes are made in the online repository.
