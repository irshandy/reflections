? What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do
it?
* When a repository is initialized, a .git directory is created inside
the directory initialized. This will enable us to use git commands in-
side the directory. We can also use file tracking now.

? How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
* Staging area is an intermediate area between working directory and
the repository. It offers more control on which files we want to add
to the repository.
